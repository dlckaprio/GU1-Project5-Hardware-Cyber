# GU1-Project5-Hardware-Cyber

### The instructions that we were given:

Each group will have to create an electronic circuit (based on an ESP32 microcontroller) and program it to : 
Read a badge
Ensure that it allows access to the requested resource
Inform the user of the result of the process (access authorized/refused, badge unknown, etc.).
⇒ It is not necessary to build a real physical access control system (lock, padlock, candy dispenser, etc.)... but an engine can simulate this function.
The user database will be located on a server that we'll consider secure for the purposes of this exercise (physical access impossible, software up to date, best practices respected, etc.).
I'll create the "server" code for you, but it's up to you to tell me what your needs are and imagine how the communication between your circuit and the server will work (wired / wireless? Which protocols?).
⇒ If you still have time... don't hesitate to try and do this part yourself!


Many extras can be added (e.g. ESP32 security or badges), and we'll be discussing them again during the course of the project, so don't hesitate to suggest any!
